      TL;DR - I am not a lawyer, so this document probably isn't great.
      Basically, it boils down to I don't share your data, you can view your
      data, you can delete your data. Just like my projects are open source, I
      aim for transparency. If you have data related questions, just ask me.
      I'll be happy to help address your concerns.
