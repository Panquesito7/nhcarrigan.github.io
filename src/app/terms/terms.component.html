  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <div class="tldr">
    <p>
      TL;DR - I am not a lawyer, so this document probably isn't great.
      Basically, it boils down to don't use my stuff to harm others, don't use
      my stuff if you're under 13, and please don't sue me if my stuff breaks.
      I'm not perfect, and neither are my applications.
