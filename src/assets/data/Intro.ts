  'I am a web developer focusing on the MEAN stack with a love for TypeScript. Development is a passion of mine, which began with the FreeCodeCamp curriculum on 15 April 2020. In December of 2020 I accepted a position with freeCodeCamp, and have continued to learn, grow, and acquire new skills.',
  'In my free time I enjoy playing a video game or reading a book. I enjoy learning new skills and picking up random bits of trivia. For example, did you know that an "emordnilap" is a word which when reversed spells another word?',
  "I am a firm believer in open-source. All of my project files are available on GitHub, and I am open to Pull Requests and suggestions on all of them. If you'd like to contribute, you can access my GitHub profile on the 'connect' page.",
